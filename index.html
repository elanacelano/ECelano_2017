        <p>My name is Elana and I am an artist who knows coding! Currently I am a Full Stack Developer who likes to get her hands dirty. Since I am an artist I love front end work. I am currently working on a few full stack projects for a few different clients.</p>
        <p>You can check out my site and see most of what I have been up to. Take a look at a few of my projects! I am really proud of all of my endevors.</p>

      <!-- <p>My Name is Elana Celano and I have been a graphic designer for the past few years. I have my BFA from Tyler School of Art, Temple University. While at Temple I studied abroad for a semester in Rome. Rome was beautiful!</p>
      <p>Since my pre-teen years, I always loved to travel. It is so exciting to see a new place with a different culture. Being an artist I thrive on new experiences.</p>
      <p>My first big trip was to France. I went to see my best friend who had just moved there, right outside of Paris. I remember spending three weeks with her. I saw Bastille Day which was absolutely magnificent! After that I was hooked. I have been to Puerto Rico with a close friend. I have seen Ireland and Israel. I even made a stop in Russia during a blizzard!</p> -->
